# BigO Rules

In BigO we have to consider 4 important rules.

## 1. Worste Case

In this rule we should to consider worst scenario. for example if we are finding `nemo` in array by using for loop we should consider that is posible to `nemo` be the last element of array not the first one.

## 2. Remove Constants

Do not forget to drop the constants for example in we have a function with `O(2n) notation` we can simply consider that as a `O(n)` so we droped `2` in this example.

## 3. Different terms for inputs

When we have multiple input and iterate to it for each iterate we should considered as a pawn for example when we have 2 input and iterate of each of them in separated loop BigO is O(n^2)
