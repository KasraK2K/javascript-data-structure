# Big O Cheat Sheet:
---

## Big O
O(1) Constant - No loops
O(log n) Logarithmic - Usually searching algorithm have log(n) if they are sorted (Binary Search not on hash map though)
O(n) Linear - For loops while loops
O(n*log(n)) Log Linear - Sorting operations usually
O(n^2) Quadratic - Every element in a collection need to be compared to ever other element. Two nested loops
O(2^n) Exponential - Recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size N
O(n!) Factorial - You are adding a loop for every element.
